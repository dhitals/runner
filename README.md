## Virtual Runner

Run along with a Virtual Runner based on your past

A fun, side-project that aims to predict the pace of your run based on
your running history, your recent mileage, and the current
environmental conditions. 

The first part---visualizing the runs uploaded from GPX files or
Strava (Garmin Connect support pending)---is up on GitHub. The
predictive part will not be on GitHub until the algorithm has fairly
decent predictive ability. Otherwise, I would just be wasting your
time.
